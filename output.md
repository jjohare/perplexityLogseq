### Summary of Logseq Markdown Block

Logseq is a powerful note-taking and outlining tool that uses markdown for formatting its text. Here is a brief summary of the content and links relevant to Logseq markdown:

- **Logseq Plugins**: Logseq plugins are installed at the user level in the `~/.logseq/plugins/` directory. Each plugin's `package.json` holds important project information, and installation-specific settings are under `~/.logseq/settings`. A Nushell script can be used to update the list of installed plugins and generate summary strings for each plugin.

- **Namespace Structure**: The current namespace implementation in Logseq can be problematic for users who prefer a hierarchical structure. Some users find it distracting and harder to read, especially when dealing with nested files and folders. There is a proposal to change how namespaces function to better align with the file system hierarchy.

- **Logseq Markdown Cheat Sheet**: Logseq uses markdown syntax for formatting its text. A cheat sheet is available for quick reference, covering elements such as headings, bold text, italics, underlines, strikethroughs, blockquotes, links, embeds, unordered and numbered lists, tasks, tables, footnotes, tags, code blocks, horizontal rules, images, and highlights.

- **Compatibility Issues**: Logseq's markdown encoding is not fully compatible with pure markdown. This can cause issues when trying to switch to another app that uses standard markdown. However, Logseq's structure is still human-readable and open-source, making it easier to convert notes to other formats.
